# daw-tech-blog

College project which revolves around creating a personal website using HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
This project is purely designed to showcase the ability to implement various functions using the technologies listed above. The posts are used instead of the plain lorem ipsum. Nothing more, nothing less.

The website resembles a tech news aggregator (currently focused on Apple news) with posts which I've taken from the following websites: frontpagetech.com and macrumors.com.
